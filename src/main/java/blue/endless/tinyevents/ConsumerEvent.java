/**
 * Represents an Event where event-responders receive one piece of information, such as an elapsed time or an event
 * source.
 * 
 * <p>To respond to an Event of this type, you need a Consumer that accepts the data this event produces - so if it's
 * a {@code ConsumerEvent<Integer>}, you need to register a {@code Consumer<Integer>}. You can also optionally supply a
 * registration key that can be used to unregister the event, and/or an Executor to defer event handler execution to.
 * 
 * <p>To "provide" a new ConsumerEvent, you might do something like,
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class Foo {
 *   private final ConsumerEvent&lt;Integer&gt; onSubmitted = ConsumerEvent.create();
 *   
 *   public ConsumerEvent&lt;Integer&gt; onSubmitted() {
 *     return onSubmitted;
 *   }
 *   
 *   public void submit(int value) {
 *     // (submit logic here)
 *     onSubmitted.fire(value);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note that generally Events fire after their corresponding logic, and their verb names are past tense, since they're
 * best used for situations where you can't change the triggering event, but you're responding to it.
 * 
 * See {@link #register(Consumer)} for more info on how to register and respond to events of this type.
